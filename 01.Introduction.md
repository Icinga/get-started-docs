Icinga is an umbrella term or brand name for a monitoring system
built from several more or less independent components.
Functionally the whole Icinga systems (actively) monitors systems or services,
stores the results of this monitoring activity, visualizes this data for
the human operators and also notifies them if things go pear-shaped.

The most prominent components are briefly explained in the following section:

 * *Icinga 2*
   is the core program of most setups. A service daemon, which acts as a, possibly distributed,
   scheduler to execute little programs, called *Monitoring Plugins*, to test or discover
   certain properties of components in the IT environment. The last sentence is intentionally rather vague as to
   what exactly Icinga 2 does, but the detailed description has its place in the specific documentation[CITATION NEEDED].

   For now the basics are:

    * Icinga 2 receives some configuration and will executed "checks" to monitor things and
      write the result to a storage backend (IcingaDB or IDO)
    * Icinga 2 instances communicate with each other via network in a tree like organisation,
      where an instance at the top (root) will configure other instance (to execute "checks")
      and receive the results of their monitoring activity in response

 * *Icinga Web 2* (*Icinga Web*)
   is a web interface (framework) which implements important basic functionality
   (e.g. user management, roles for permission management) which can be harnessed by _Modules_.
   These _Modules_ implement then the visualisation of monitoring activities ("IcingaDB Web" or the "monitoring" module),
   perform monitoring activies themselves (e.g. the "x509" or the "vSphereDB" module) or
   the graphical configuration of Icinga 2 (the "Icinga Director").

* *IcingaDB*
  The umbrella term for the current storage backend for Icinga 2 as well as the daemon program
  which represents part of the implementation.

* *IDO* (Icinga Data Output)
  The old (legacy) storage backend for Icinga 2. This component is deprecated!

* *Icinga Director*
  A _module_ for Icinga Web 2 with the purpose of providing a more accessible way to
  configure Icinga 2. This is likely the most common way to generate configuration (althoug
  not the only one).
  The director also provides data import and manipulation functionality to generate the monitoring
  configuration in an automatic way which is helpful or even necessary in bigger setups.

* *Icinga for Windows*
  is again a umbrella term for different components which handle the installation and management of
  Icinga components on Windows machines in a setup and also provide functionality to monitor those machines.
